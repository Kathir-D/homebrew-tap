  # Sonar is ad-hoc signed and not notarized, so Gatekeeper would otherwise make
  # every user approve it by hand in System Settings on first launch.
  #
  # Homebrew used to offer --no-quarantine for this, but it was removed in 7.x
  # ("Error: invalid option: --no-quarantine") and there is no cask DSL
  # replacement: `postflight_steps` exposes only if_path_exists / on_macos /
  # version / token, and cannot run a command at all. The deprecated
  # `postflight` block can, and still runs.
  #
  # The rescue matters. Without it, removing `postflight` would not merely stop
  # the quarantine from being cleared - it would make the cask file invalid, and
  # an invalid cask stops the whole tap from loading, so `brew tap` would fail
  # and nobody could install anything. Rescued, the worst case is that users get
  # the normal one-time Gatekeeper approval again.
  #
  # The ordering is what makes this reasonable rather than reckless: Homebrew
  # verifies the SHA-256 above before any of this runs, so the checksum is the
  # integrity gate and the quarantine attribute is no longer what stands between
  # the user and an app they knowingly installed from this tap.
